Next Steps
Refine Feature Set:

Test the impact of including or excluding marginal variables (e.g., meal_plan_*).
Use feature selection techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, Lasso regression).
Check for Interaction Effects:

Explore interactions like lead_time Ã— market_segment_type_Online.
Model Testing:

Build a baseline model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) using the selected features.
