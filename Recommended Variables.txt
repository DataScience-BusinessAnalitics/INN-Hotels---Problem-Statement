Based on the VIF analysis, correlation heatmap, and overall feature relevance, here’s a recommended set of variables to use for modeling. These variables strike a balance between independence, relevance, and interpretability.

Recommended Variables
1️⃣ Key Predictive Features (Strong Relationships with booking_status)
lead_time_log: High relevance, as it directly impacts booking behavior.
no_of_special_requests: Indicates engagement or complexity in the booking process, slightly correlated with cancellations (~-0.25).
avg_price_per_room_std: Standardized price feature, correlated with market segment and behavior.

2️⃣ Guest-Related Features
repeated_guest: Whether a guest is returning, as loyal customers are less likely to cancel.
total_guests_centered: Represents total people per booking, now decoupled from other variables.

3️⃣ Historical Booking Behavior
no_of_previous_cancellations: Indicates a history of cancellations, likely predictive of future cancellations.
no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled: Helps balance the cancellation history by showing successful bookings.

4️⃣ Market Segment and Room Type
market_segment_type_Online: Strong relationship with cancellation patterns, as online bookings tend to have higher cancellation rates.
room_type_reserved_* (e.g., Room_Type_4, Room_Type_6): Relevant for guest preferences and booking outcomes.

5️⃣ Contextual Features
total_stay: Captures the length of stay, which may impact booking decisions.
Season Variables (season_Spring, season_Summer, etc.): Weak correlations, but potentially important for capturing trends.

6️⃣ Optional Features
required_car_parking_space: While weakly correlated, it may provide additional context if parking needs affect cancellations.
type_of_meal_plan_*: May capture subtle guest preferences.

Final Feature Set
Here’s the consolidated list:

lead_time_log
no_of_special_requests
avg_price_per_room_std
repeated_guest
total_guests_centered
no_of_previous_cancellations
no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled
market_segment_type_Online
room_type_reserved_Room_Type_4
room_type_reserved_Room_Type_6
total_stay
season_Spring, season_Summer, season_Winter
Next Steps
Use these variables (X) to train a model.
Evaluate Feature Importance:
Use a model like Random Forest or Logistic Regression to check which features contribute the most.
Test Performance:
Compare model results with and without optional features to confirm their contribution.
